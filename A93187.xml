            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:115693:6"/>to a more publick benefit) with ſome little enlargement, it is now Printed. I wiſh, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, nor any that heard it, may finde cauſe to ſay of it, as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> once did of a Sermon Preach'd before her Majeſty, and Printed at her command; of which (after the reading of it) ſhe ſaid, <hi>It was the beſt Sermon Preach'd, but the worſt Read, that ever ſhe heard and read.</hi> If you judge the like of this after you have read it, I ſhall not think it ſtrange; being well aſſur'd, that my Sermons (by reaſon of the plainneſſe of my ſtile) are fitter for the Pulpit than the Preſſe, and more acceptable in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

We have been like a body beheaded, for which no other head will ſerve, how artificially ſoever it be ſet on, and how quickly do thoſe heads fall off, that are but clap'd on upon us? which wanting a natural conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, will ſtand no longer than they are upheld by force; neither can there be any conveyance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits where there is not the right uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115693:14"/>Solemnities, none have been more forward than God's moſt faithfull Prophets and Prieſts, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel.

                  <hi>And</hi> Zadock <hi>the Prieſt took an horn of Oyl out of the Tabernacle, and annointed</hi> Solomon: <hi>and they blew the trumpet, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſaid, God ſave King</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with Pipes, and rejoyced with great joy, ſo that the earth rent with the ſound of them.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The words are Hiſtoricall, and in them you have a Relation of the Proclamation and Inauguration of <hi>Solomon</hi> to be King over <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For methods ſake and your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding of them, you may take notice,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the Agents or Perſons who were imployed in the obſervation of theſe ſolemnities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of their Actions, or the things done and performed by theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:115693:15"/>
            <p n="3">3. Of the Perſon, about whoſe concernments theſe Agents were imployed.</p>
            <p>The Agents were <hi>Zadok the Preiſt,</hi> (who began the ſolemnity) and the reſt of the people who were then preſent, among whom (for the honour of the ſolemnity) was <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than the Prophet,</hi> and many others, men of great account and eſteem both in the Church and State of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as evidently appears by the verſe immediately foregoing. <hi>So Zadock the Prieſt and Nathan the Prophet and Benaiah the ſon of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went downe, and cauſed Solomon to ride upon King David's Mule, &amp;c.</hi> And from hence I conclude.</p>
            <p>That it is a thing no way unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Prieſt,
<note place="margin">Note.</note> a Prophet, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God, to act his part in the Procla mation, and Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of his juſt, and lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115693:15"/>
            <p n="2">2. The Actions of theſe Agents, and they are divers, every man (in this Solemnity) was imployed in ſome thing ſuitable to his place and ſtation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Zadok the Prieſt</hi> begins the work, 'tis ſaid he <hi>took a Horne of oyle out of the Tabernacle, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed Solomon.</hi> A Ceremony frequently uſed (by God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and appointment) in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, and Inauguration of Perſons to be Kings, as you may ſee by comparing theſe Scriptures, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.16. <hi>I will ſend thee a man out of the land of benjamin, and thou ſhalt anoint him to be Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine over my People Iſrael, that he may ſave my People out of the hand of the Philiſtines.</hi> So cap. 10. v. 1. <hi>Then Samuel took a viall of oyle, and poured it upon his head, and kiſſed him, and ſaid, Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath anointed thee to be Captain over his Inheritance?</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115693:16"/>So <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to Samuel, &amp;c. Fill thy horn with oyle, and goe, I will ſend thee to</hi> Jeſſe <hi>the Bethlemite, for I have provided me a King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his ſons.</hi> Item v. 13. <hi>Then Samuel took the horne of oyle and anointed him in the midſt of his Brethren: and the ſpirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward.</hi> Againe. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2 4. And the men of Judah came and <hi>there they anointed David King</hi> over the houſe of <hi>Judah:</hi> ſo 1. <hi>Cron.</hi> 29.22. and they made <hi>Solomon</hi> King the ſecond time, <hi>and anointed him to the Lord to be chief Governor.</hi> And this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was upon theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons uſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To declare, that God had called, and appointed the Perſon thus anointed to the exerciſe of the office of a King.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115693:16"/>
            <p n="2">2. To give aſſurance (to others and) to the perſons thus anointed, that God would furniſh them with gifts, graces, and abilities, for the diſcharge of the Kingly office, to which he had deſigned, and called them. And from the uſe of this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie it is that Kings in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are often called <hi>the Lord's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,</hi> as you may ſee, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.6. God forbid that I ſhould do this thing unto my Maſter the <hi>Lord's anointed,</hi> &amp;c. Seing he is <hi>the anointed of the Lord.</hi> So, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.1. thus ſaith the Lord <hi>to his anointed, to Cyrus,</hi> &amp;c. and in many other places.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Priest</hi> having done his part, the Trumpeters performed their parts, they blew the trumpet and by the ſound of trumpet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him King.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All the people which were preſent, cryed, <hi>God ſave King Solomon,</hi> and then followed,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115693:17"/>after him, and piped with pipes and rejoyced with exceeding great joy; ſo that the earth rent with the ſound of their ſhouts and acclamations of joy; an <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall</hi> ſpeech to expreſſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſs of their joy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Solomon</hi> the ſon of <hi>David</hi> (by <hi>Bathſheba</hi> who had been the wife of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>) was the perſon about whoſe concernments theſe Agents were thus imployed. The perſon about whoſe, &amp;c. I ſay, was <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> who was,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not only a <hi>Prince,</hi> but a <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince,</hi> being appointed of God, and <hi>nominated</hi> by <hi>David</hi> his Royall father to ſucceed him in his government, as you may ſee by comparing the 1. <hi>Chr.</hi> 28. and 5. with this. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.28. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A hopefull Prince,</hi> a Prince from whom they might expect much good, both to the <hi>Church and Sate</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115693:17"/>becauſe he was, 1. A very <hi>pious Prince.</hi> 2. A very <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>prudent Prince.</hi> 3. <hi>A beloved Prince,</hi> beloved even of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with a ſpeciall love, and therefore called <hi>Jedediah.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24, 25. And ſhe bare a ſon and he called his name <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>the Lord loved him, &amp;c. and he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his name Jedidiah, becauſe of the Lord.</hi> 4. A <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> or a peaceable Prince. So much is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed by his name <hi>Solomon.</hi> 1. <hi>Chr.</hi> 22.9. Behold a ſon ſhall be borne to thee, who ſhall be a <hi>man of reſt,</hi> and I will give <hi>him rest from all his enemies round about:</hi> for his name ſhall be <hi>Solomon,</hi> and I will give <hi>peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse to Iſrael in his dayes.</hi> He was called ſo, to ſhew that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael ſhould enjoy much peace under his government. Now the conſideration of theſe and ſuch like things, was the cauſe why the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115693:18"/>people preſent at his proclamation and inauguration were thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with exceeding great joy and rejoycing. From all which put together you may obſerve this point of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>That <hi>the acceſſion of a lawfull hopefull Prince</hi> to the <hi>actuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe of Rule and Government,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
               </label> is a thing greatly to be rejoyced in, by all thoſe over whom he is to rule and govern.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this is a thing greatly to be rejoyced in, &amp;c. is evident by the <hi>univerſall</hi> practice of all good and loyall ſubjects in all Ages Countryes and Nations: whoſe conſtant uſe it hath been, to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize the acceſſion of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hopefull <hi>Princes</hi> to actuall rule and Government, with all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Domonſtrations of joy and rejoycing. How exceſſively did this people here reioyce at <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's</hi> acceſſion to the Throne?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115693:18"/>this was matter of rejoycing, not onely to the common rabble and rude multitude, but to <hi>Zadok</hi> the Prieſt &amp; <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet alſo: theſe as well as others, who were preſent, rejoyced at it with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great joy. Which, being wiſe and pious men, they would not have done, had it not been a thing greatly to be rejoyced in.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The truth of this is further e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by theſe two following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the acceſſion of ſuch a Prince to actuall Rule and Government will aſſuredly <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,</hi>
               <note n="1" place="margin">Reaſ.</note> or <hi>put to an end</hi> many (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe) unavoidable miſcheifs and inconveniencies, to which the people of a State and Kingdome are incident, and obnoxious, for want of ſuch a Prince to rule and govern them. Many are the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes and inconveniencies to which the people of a State and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115693:19"/>Kingdome are liable, for want of a lawfull Prince to rule and govern them; all which miſchiefs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies are either prevented or put to an end by the acceſſion of ſuch a Prince to actual Rule and Government. I ſhall name ſome of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The acceſſion of ſuch a Prince to actual Rule and Government, will either prevent or put to an end the aſpiring attempts of proud and ambitious men, to exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the higheſt place of power and authority; together with thoſe many inconveniencies &amp; miſchiefs that accompany or follow their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. When a People are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a lawful Prince to rule them, every ambitious perſon that can but head a Faction, will be ready to take the opportunity of ſetling himſelf upon the Throne. In an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> every man who can make a party to aſſiſt him, will be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115693:19"/>climbing up unto the Throne. Now the miſchiefs and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies that befall a State or Kingdome by the aſpiring attempts of ambitious men, to poſſeſſe themſelvs of power and authority, are innumerable. Such were the miſchiefs that befel the people of the ten Tribes (upon this account) after their revolt from the Houſe of <hi>David.</hi> After they had rejected their lawful Sovereign, thoſe that were ambitious were ſtill ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for Authority amongſt them: by reaſon whereof innumerable miſchiefs befel them. But now (I ſay) the acceſſion of a lawfull Prince, &amp;c. will either prevent or put to an end theſe ſad miſchiefs and inconveniencies. This was the effect of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s acceſſion to the Throne; it put to an end the aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring attempts of <hi>Adonijah</hi> to make himſelf King, together with the many inconveniencies that were
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115693:20"/>like to follow upon it, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.5, 49, and 50. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes compared. <hi>Then</hi> Adonijah <hi>the ſon of</hi> Haggith <hi>exalted himſelf, ſaying, I will be King: and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him Charriots and horſmen, and fifty men to run before him. — And all the Gueſts that were with</hi> Adonijah <hi>were afraid, and roſe up, and went every man his way. — And</hi> Adonijah <hi>feared becauſe of</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>and aroſe, and went and caught hold on the horns of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The acceſſion of ſuch a Prince to rule and government will either prevent, or put to an end, the Tyrannies and Cruelties which are uſually exerciſed by ſuch as exalt themſelves, and uſurp Authority. It is almoſt impoſſible for a Prince to be a <hi>Tyrant</hi> in <hi>Title,</hi> and not be a <hi>Tyrant</hi> in <hi>Exerciſe.</hi> Such as get power wickedly, do (for the moſt part) uſe it unjuſtly: Though
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115693:20"/>(<hi>Abſalom</hi>-like) they may make fair promiſes, to make a party to lift them to the Throne; yet they ſeldom or never obſerve and keep them. The truth of this evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears almoſt in the whole <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after their revolt from the Houſe of <hi>David.</hi> The moſt of them were not only <hi>Tyrants</hi> in <hi>Title,</hi> but in <hi>Exerciſe</hi> alſo. But now the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a lawful hopeful Prince to the actual exerciſe of Rule and Government, will prevent, or put to a period theſe Tyrannies and cruelties, which Uſurpers uſually exerciſe over an enſlaved Nation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The acceſſion of ſuch a Prince to Rule and Government, will aſſuredly prevent or put to an end, thoſe <hi>Rapines</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> whereby the people are ſubject to be oppreſſed, <hi>every one by another, and every one by his Neighbour.</hi> When the ſeat of Authority is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115693:21"/>or poſſeſſed by ſuch as have no right or ability to Rule; the people are in danger tobe <hi>oppreſſed every one by another.</hi> When there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> every man did what ſeemed good in his own eyes, though it were to the hurt and prejudice of others; as you may ſee, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.1, and 18. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, <hi>In thoſe days there was no King in Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>cap.</hi> 19.1, 25. compar'd. And the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are men in danger of, when the Seat of Authority is poſſeſſed by ſuch as have no right or ſkill to Rule: hence a wo is denounc'd againſt that land <hi>whoſe King is a Child, Eccl.</hi> 10.16. <hi>i.e.</hi> who is as unfit and unſkilful to Rule, and as much wedded to his own will, as a childe is. And therefore when God is angry with a people, he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens <hi>to give Children to be their Kings, and that Babes ſhould rule over them, Iſa.</hi> 3.4. <hi>i. e.</hi> men of a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115693:21"/>childiſh diſpoſition; in reſpect of wit, ſkill, carriage, courage, no better than Children, or in ſome ſort worſe, becauſe more wilfull, and leſſe adviſable. And now that land where ſuch rule, muſt needs be in a woe caſe, becauſe where ſuch rule, every man is ſubject to be oppreſſed by his neigbour; as appears by 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4,5. <hi>And I will give children to be their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and babes ſhall rule over them and the people ſhall be oppreſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one by another and every one by his Neighbour: the child ſhall behave himſelf proudly againſt the ancient, and the baſe againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable.</hi> But the acceſſion of a lawfull and hopefull Prince, &amp;c. will undoubtedly prevent, or put to an end theſe miſchievous evils that elſe would happen to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple over which he is to rule.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The acceſſion of a hopefull and lawfull Prince to Rule and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115693:22"/>Government will certainely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or put to an end thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivous diſputes, and diviſions, which otherwiſe will ariſe amongſt a people, about the <hi>particular forme of Government, the perſon, or perſons by which they will be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> When the ſeat of Authority is vacant, or poſſeſſed by uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; every man, as he is affected, will be contending to be ruled under this or that particular form of government, or by this or that particular perſon. The truth of this we have ſeen made good by ſad experience even in our dayes. How have diſputes about theſe things, broken and crumbled us into a thouſand pieces, ſince the horrid murther of his late Majeſty of glorious memory, and the <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous exile,</hi> &amp;c. of his preſent moſt Royal and moſt excellent Majeſty! Now this miſchief alſo, the acceſſion of, &amp;c. will aſſuredly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115693:22"/>either prevent or put to an end.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The acceſſion of a lawfull hopeful Prince to Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, will alſo prevent or put to an end thoſe frequent and miſchievous changes in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which a State and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is Subject through the want of ſuch a Prince to Rule and govern it. Frequent changes in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either in reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ruling, or the form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which it is ruled, are very deſtructive and miſchievous to it. And therefore when God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with a people, he uſually brings this Judgement upon them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.2. <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of a Land, many are the Princes thereof, &amp;c.</hi> And of all Kingdoms thoſe are moſt ſubject to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Judgment, where their lawful Sovereign is rejected, and the Throne is poſſeſſed by Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. How often did the ten
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115693:23"/>Tribes change their Rulers, after their Revolt from the Houſe of <hi>David?</hi> and what frequent chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, both of Governors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment have we ſeen in this Nation, ſince the murther of our late, and Exilement of our preſent Sovereign! but by the acceſſion of a lawful hopeful Prince to Rule, theſe changes are either prevented, or put to an end, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.2. <hi>For the tranſgreſſion of a land many are the Princes thereof; but by a man of understanding and knowledge, the ſtate thereof ſhall be prolonged, i. e.</hi> by a lawful Prince, who is wiſe and prudent the ſtate thereof ſhall be preſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> from ſuch frequent and miſchievous changes of its Governors and Rulers. Theſe are ſome of thoſe great miſchiefs which by this means will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or put to an end; and therefore the acceſſion of a lawful hopeful Prince to actual Rule and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115693:23"/>Government, is a thing greatly to be rejoyced in by thoſe over whom he is to rule. But ſecondly,</p>
            <p>The Acceſſion of ſuch a Prince to actual Rule and Government,
<note n="2" place="margin">Reaſ.</note> s a thing greatly to be rejoyced in; becauſe it gives the people, over whom he is to rule, great hope of much approaching and continued good to them, by his rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over them: A lawful hopeful Ruler is a great bleſſing to a Nation; and therefore God promiſeth to beſtow ſuch upon his people as a great bleſſing to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.26. <hi>And I will reſtore thy Judges as at the first, and thy Counſellors as at the beginning, i. e.</hi> I will give thee Rulers like unto thoſe which I ſet over thee, when thou wert firſt conſtituted a State and Kingdom? ſuch as were <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Joſhua, Samuel, David, &amp;c.</hi> ſuch as ſhall be Inſtruments of much good unto thee; as all good
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115693:24"/>and lawful Princes are to all ſuch as they rule over. Now the good a people have grounds to hope for upon the acceſſion of a lawful hopeful Prince to Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The injoyment of outward peace, plenty, and proſperity.</hi> By <hi>Solomon's</hi> acceſſion to the throne, the <hi>ſtate of Iſrael</hi> injoyed the good of all theſe. The whole time of the Reign of <hi>Solomon,</hi> they did not onely injoy peace; (acording as God had promiſed they ſhould 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.9. <hi>For his name ſhall be Solomon, and I will give Peace and quietneſſe unto Iſrael in his dayes.</hi>) But alſo great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and proſperity, as you may ſee 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10.27. <hi>And the King made ſilver to be in Jeruſalem as ſtones, and Cedars made he to be as the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camore trees which are in the vale for abundance.</hi> And 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.15. in the ſame words. And thus it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115693:24"/>often comes to paſſe by the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a <hi>lawfull, hopefull Prince</hi> to Rule and Government; and therefore there is ground to hope upon the acceſſion of ſuch a Prince to Rule and Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The right adminiſtration and execution of law and juſtice. This good and benefit Iſrael injoyed by the acceſſion of <hi>Solomon</hi> to Rule and Government, as a peares by many inſtances, eſpecially by his deciſion of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Harlots about the living child. 1 <hi>king.</hi> 3 <hi>from the</hi> 16 <hi>to the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Safety and protection from all wrong and injury, or at leaſt juſtice againſt ſuch as wrong and injure them, as 'tis the duty, ſo 'tis (for the moſt part) the diſpoſition of lawfull Princes, to protect their Subjects (yea the meaneſt of them) from wrong, and injury, and to do ſuch of them right as are wronged
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115693:25"/>and injured. This good alſo Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael injoyed by <hi>Solomon's</hi> acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the throne, as appears by the foregoing inſtance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Suitable rewards and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their deſerts and merits. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers</hi> beſtow their rewards and preferments upon ſuch as are righteſt for their turne, but law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Princes (if they are wiſe and prudent) upon them who are moſt deſerving, but eſpecially upon ſuch as are moſt faithfull to God within their dominions, ſuch <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> reſolved to prefer to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of being next, yea neareſt to his perſon in attendance upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. throughout, but eſpecially <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithfull of the land, that they may dwell with me. He that walketh in a perfect way he ſhall ſerve me. By the faithful</hi> there he means, the <hi>truly godly in the land:</hi> as appears from the latter
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115693:25"/>part of the verſe. And ſuch were they whom <hi>Solomon</hi> advanced, upon his acceſſion to the throne, as appears by 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. begining.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The preſervation and (if need be) the <hi>Reformation</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with due countenance and encouragement in the practice and profeſſion of it. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> for the moſt part, are <hi>Corrupters</hi> and <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſers</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>power of Religion.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> and thoſe Kings that ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.26, 27. &amp;c. to the end. <hi>And Jeroboam ſaid in his heart, now ſhall the Kingdome return to the houſe of David: If this people go up to do ſacrifice in the Houſe of the Lord at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, then ſhall the heart of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple turn again unto their Lord, even unto Rehoboam King of Judah, and they ſhall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam King of Judah: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115693:26"/>the King took counſel, and made two Calves of gold, and ſaid unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jeruſalem; Behold thy gods, O Iſrael, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt:</hi> and ſo on. You may ſee more of this in the Hiſtories of his Succeſſors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles.</hi> But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſuch as are lawful and pious Princes, are Preſervers, Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and (if need require) Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Religion; yea, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancers of the moſt ſincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it. Such were all the godly Kings of <hi>Judah:</hi> Such a one was <hi>Aſa,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>And Aſa did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, as did David his Father. And he took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Sodomites out of the Land, and removed all the Idols that his Father had made. And alſo Maa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha his Mother, even her he removed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115693:26"/>from being Queen, becauſe ſhe had made an Idol in a Grove, and Aſa deſtroyed her Idol, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis true, his reformation was not a through reformation, but yet he was a great Reformer; and ſo was his Son and Succeſſor <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.41, 42, 43. <hi>He walked in all the wayes of Aſa his Father, he turned not aſide from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he did not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Reformation of his Predeceſſors, but he carried it on to a higher degree of perfection. He did not only break the Images, but he alſo removed the High places, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.3, 4. And ſo we finde, that <hi>Solomon's</hi> acceſſion to the Throne made much for the advantage of Religion, and the Profeſſors of it. For immediately upon his coming to it, he built the Temple, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115693:27"/>did very much beautifie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Worſhip and Service of God.</p>
            <p>Now the Uſe and Application of this point is two-fold: and,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> The firſt is a Uſe of Reproof, for ſuch amongſt us (if any ſuch there be) who do not rejoice, but grieve at the acceſſion of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the ſecond to Rule and Government. If I thought there were any ſuch preſent, I would enlarge upon this Uſe: but I hope better things of you all, and therefore I forbear, leſt I ſhould this day ſadden the heart of any, who will otherwiſe rejoyce.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> I ſhall therefore come to the ſecond Uſe, a Uſe of Exhortation, to exhort and ſtir you up to the obſervation of the ſolemnity of this day with all poſſible joy and cordial rejoycing. And I beſeech you, let us all this day rejoice
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115693:27"/>with exceeding great joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing. Now to quicken and raiſe your hearts to a rejoicing ſuitable to the ſolemnity of this day, conſider, you have as good cauſe of rejoicing at the Solemnity of this day, as they had who were preſent at the Proclamation and Inauguration of <hi>Solomon:</hi> Seeing the <hi>Prince,</hi> whoſe Proclamation-Solemnities you are this day to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, may be in ſome meaſure <hi>(and that without flattery)</hi> compar'd with <hi>Solomon,</hi> at whoſe Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this people ſo greatly rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: For, as <hi>Solomon</hi> was, ſo he is, 1. A lawfull; and 2. A hopefull Prince. I ſay, he is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Legitimate and a lawful Prince. He is not a ſpurious Muſhrume ſelf-created Prince: but a Prince by lineal ſucceſſion and inherent birth-right, being lineally deſcended by the Father of glorious memory, from <hi>James</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:115693:28"/>of bleſſed memory, the 6. of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but the firſt of <hi>Great Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and by the Mother, from that great and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Heroe</hi> of his age, <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. of <hi>France.</hi> So that our King is, on both ſides, the <hi>Son of Nobles.</hi> And when it is ſo, <hi>Solomon</hi> tels you, <hi>the Land is bleſſed, Eccleſ.</hi> 10.17. And as he is a Noble, ſo he is a lawful Prince too. The clearneſs of his Title is ſuch, that to argue the lawfulneſſe of it, would but darken and eclipſe it. You may as well queſtion the ſhining of the Sun at noon, as the lawfulneſſe of his Title.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is as a lawful, ſo a hopeful Prince. A Prince by whoſe acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to rule and government we are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. At preſent freed from our feares and dangers of being <hi>hareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> by the attempts of every <hi>aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ambitious Adonijah,</hi> to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115693:28"/>make himſelfe King. We need not now to feare the aſpiring am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition either of a <hi>Cromwell</hi> or a <hi>Lambert.</hi> Nor need we now feare of being kept in bondage and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by an inconſiderable part of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> or a <hi>Phanatick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of ſafety</hi> under the notion <hi>of a free State, or Commonwealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We have grounds of hope that his acceſſion to Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will be a meanes, in time, to free us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From our <hi>unſupportable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> of <hi>Exciſe</hi> and <hi>monthly Taxes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From our <hi>ſoul-deſtroying and damning univerſall tolleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We have ground to hope that his acceſſion to actuall rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, will be a meanes of much good both to our ſelves and the whole Nation. There is now hopes,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we ſhall enjoy a ſetled Government, our antient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115693:29"/>of King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: the beſt forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the wiſedome of man could ever yet contrive, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Tyranny</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Annarchy and Confuſion</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we may recover and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a <hi>firme and laſting peace.</hi> Not onely a peace within our ſelves, but a peace with the Nations, which are round about us. Such a peace as <hi>Iſrael</hi> enjoyed all the days of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had <hi>peace on all ſides round about him, ſo that Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and Judah dwelt ſafely, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man under his vine, and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba.</hi> As you may ſee 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.24, 25.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That we may again enjoy an <hi>equall diſtribution of law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> We need not now to fear of being <hi>outlawed</hi> for refuſing to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure our ſelves</hi> by ſubſcribing an
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115693:29"/>
               <hi>Engagement,</hi> or taking an Oath <hi>of abjuration,</hi> contrary to our former Oaths of <hi>allegiance and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, or ſolemn league and covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That we may againe enjoy <hi>freedome of Trade</hi> both at home and abroad; and thereby recover our <hi>exhauſted and of late miſ-ſpent treaſure.</hi> If any thing in the world be a meanes to revive Trade in the Nation, his Majeſty's acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Government will be the meanes to doe it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That we may recover <hi>our wonted honour and renowne, in forreign parts and Countries.</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland hath been as renowned a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as any in the world, both for <hi>Courage, Policy,</hi> and <hi>Pyety.</hi> But the ſtrange actings of ſome men in our late revolutions, and changes hath made us the contempt, ſcorn, and hatred of the whole world. It hath made moſt men believe that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115693:30"/>we have loſt both our piety, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and courage too. But now by the Reſtitution of his Majeſty it will appear to all the world, that there are ſome men both of piety, policy, and courage left among us, ſo that by this meanes we may recover our honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That we may now enjoy the liberty of our perſons. We need not now to feare of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for meer <hi>pretended crimes and imaginary plots, and deſigns againſt the State.</hi> There's hopes now that no mans perſon ſhall be attached, or impriſoned, but in a legall way.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Laſtly. (Which is more then all) There is now hopes that we may ſee a through <hi>reformation of things amiſſe in our religion;</hi> and from henceforth enjoy the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Goſpel-worſhip and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their full power and purity
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115693:30"/>and ſo (in due time) through the bleſſing of God, ſee an end of all our ſeperations and Church diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And all this we may hope for upon the acceſſion of the Kings Majeſty to actuall Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if we conſider, 1. The various &amp; even miraculous provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God towards him. 2. If we conſider his Majeſty in reſpect of his perſonall qualifications for rule and Government. I begin with the firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The providence of God in afflicting of him, in ſuffering him to be <hi>Exiled out of his native Countrey and Dominions:</hi> to be perſecuted, and enforced to fly from one Countrey to another, by the <hi>Tyranny of his Enemies at home; by the falſhood and treachery of pretended friends abroad.</hi> The providence of God in this kind, I know, hath been made uſe of as an
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115693:31"/>Argument, that God had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or pleaſure in him. But, Brethren, for my part, I cannot but look upon it as an Argument that God hath deſigned him to be an Inſtrument of much good to us. And I cannot but think, that Gods deſign in afflicting of him, was to humble and to fit him for Rule and Government. And indeed, God uſually takes this courſe with ſuch as he hath deſigned, to be Inſtruments of much good to his Church and People. This very courſe he took with <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 37.27, &amp;c. with <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 2.15. with <hi>David:</hi> He ſuffered him by the Tyranny of <hi>Saul, to be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out from the Inheritance of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.19. Thus God dealt with them, to fit them for Rule and Government; and we have reaſon to think that God took this courſe with His Majeſty to the ſame end. And, no doubt, he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115693:31"/>is the better fitted for Rule and Government by his Sufferings. It is not imaginable, that one who hath ſo long <hi>groaned under tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> ſhould <hi>become a Tyrant;</hi> that one who hath ſo long felt the ſmart of <hi>injuſtice,</hi> ſhould be <hi>unjust</hi> to others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, there is hopes of all this good by his acceſſion to Rule and Government, if you conſider, <hi>the wonderfull providence of God over him, in the preſervation of his perſon, and in delivering him out of the hands of all his Enemies.</hi> His dangers have been great, and his deliverances have been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, both at <hi>Worceſter</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. In this reſpect God hath wrought well-nigh as wonderfully for him, as he did for <hi>Moſes, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> or <hi>David:</hi> And this, to me, is another Argument, that God hath deſigned him to be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of much good to theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115693:32"/>and to his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in them. And that there is hope, will further appear, if you conſider:</p>
            <p n="3">3. The wonderful providence of God, <hi>in making way for his Reſtitution to Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And in this reſpect, <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God hath been wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, even to aſtoniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In plucking down <hi>Richard, by his neareſt Relations,</hi> and the ſame hands that ſet him up; by which means they opened an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ectual door for their own ruine, and for His Majeſties peaceable Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In <hi>blaſting and infatuating the Counſels</hi> of his <hi>implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> of every kinde; ſo as to cauſe them to daſh one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and to throw themſelves down by their own hands.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In ſtirring up the Spirit of the <hi>deſervedly Renowned General
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115693:32"/>MONCK, with his faithfull Army,</hi> to diſown, and declare againſt the <hi>Councel of Turkiſh-Chriſtian-Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> and their <hi>Committee of Safety.</hi> Both which, by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial providence of God, he quickly ſcattered as duſt before the wind. Firſt by ſitting ſtill, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by a peaceable and prudent march to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In raiſing a <hi>ſpirit of courage in the generality of the people,</hi> throughout this Nation, to <hi>declare for the admiſſion of the ſecluded Members,</hi> and the calling of a <hi>free Parliament,</hi> both which, with the bleſſing of God upon the <hi>General's</hi> prudent management of affairs, we have ſeen effected.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In putting it into the hearts of this preſent Parliament, (acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their duty and allegiance) to reſtore his ſacred <hi>Majeſty;</hi> &amp; in turning about the hearts of all the Commanders, both by ſea and land
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115693:33"/>to receive his moſt Royal Majeſty againe into his Dominions. In all which the wonderfull power and providence of God hath <hi>ſignally apeared.</hi> So that we may ſay of our <hi>Sovereigne's Reſtitution</hi> what <hi>David</hi> ſaid of our <hi>Saviors Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Pſal.</hi> 118.22, 23. <hi>The ſtone which the Builders refuſed is become the head ſtone of the corner; This is the Lord's doing, and it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous in our eyes.</hi> And upon this ground we have reaſon to hope for much approaching good to theſe Nations by the acceſſion of his moſt excellent Majeſty to the exerciſe of Rule and Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you conſider him in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (I mean his moſt excellent Majeſty) without the leaſt reſpect to theſe ſignall and (in a manner) miraculous providences of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; you ſhall find him in all reſpects a very hopeful Prince, every way as hopefull as any that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115693:33"/>hath hitherto ſwayed the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Scepter of theſe Dominions. And this you ſhall finde evidently to appeare, if you pleaſe to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all prejudice, and look upon him with a judicious and impartial eye; indeed if you look upon him under that ſhape and repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein our <hi>late <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers</hi> have from time to time expoſed him to publick view, you cannot but thinke him the unfitteſt perſon in the world to wear the Imperial Crowne of theſe Realmes. But I hope you have attained to more grace and wiſdom than to believe what his perſecuting enemies, by Jeſuitical example <hi>and inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have reported of him,</hi> who have done by him as the Papiſts of old did by <hi>John Huſſe.</hi> They have (as it were) cloathed him in <hi>a coat of painted Devils:</hi> nay, have repreſented him in the ſhape of <hi>an incarnate Devil,</hi> thereby to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115693:34"/>make him odious to his ſubjects, &amp; (if it could have been) to have rendred his reſtitution to his juſt rights impoſſible. But bleſſed be the Lord who hath curſed this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh policy! and hath reſtored him to his Right. And now that you may know him to be a hopefull Prince, I ſhall at preſent give you a true, but ſhort, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of him. And this I ſhall doe not to curry favour, but to ſatisfie your doubts, and quiet your feares concerning his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, whoſe excellent endowments I am fully perſwaded, doe far tranſcend what my tongue or pen can expreſs of him. So that when I have ſaid all, I would have you to conceive him to be far more eminent than I can repreſent him unto you. However, for your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, give me leave (as in a glaſſe) to give you as it were a dark &amp; ſhady reſemblance of him.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115693:34"/>And herein I ſhall ſpeak as in the preſence of God and therefore ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothing, but what I am fully perſwaded is moſt true and reall. But to come to the buſineſs, if you view him well with an unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced eye, you ſhall finde him to be,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Prince moſt eminently ſtout and valiant;</hi> of the truth of this he gave an undeniable proof at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> his enemies themſelvs being Judges. His moſt capitall enemy <hi>Oliver,</hi> then General againſt him, at a publick feſtival entertainment in <hi>London</hi> upon the occaſion of his victory over his Majeſties Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, there gave this teſtimony of him. Which together with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerableneſs of his ſpirit under all his <hi>(ſufficiently great)</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, is an evident demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the more than ordinary ſtoutneſs of his ſpirit, acording to that of <hi>Solomon. Pro.</hi> 18.14. <hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115693:35"/>infirmity.</hi> And (indeed) had not his ſpirit been like himſelf, great, it had been impoſſible for him to have borne up under afflictions of ſo great a weight. And this is the firſt qualification or princely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that you may finde him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with. And this is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a qualification for a Prince, that without it he can neither op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Enemies, protect his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or execute impartial juſtice upon Offenders.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you view him with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced eye, you ſhall finde him to be a very <hi>wiſe and prudent Prince:</hi> a Prince, who is neither a <hi>Childe in age,</hi> nor in <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> He is not like <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who at 40 years of age was but a very Baby, both in reſpect of wiſdom and experience, as plainly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his rejecting the wiſe and prudent Counſels of his Fathers old and experienced Councellors;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115693:35"/>and by imbracing the violent and heady advice of his own raw and (as to State-affairs) unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Play-mates and Companions: By which his Childiſh folly and indiſcretion (through the juſt judgement of God upon him) he occaſioned the Revolt of the ten Tribes from him, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.8, 13, 14, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c. But he forſook the counſel of the old men, which they had given him: and conſulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which ſtood before him. — And the King anſwered them roughly, and ſpake to them after the counſel of the yong men, ſaying, my Father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke, &amp;c. So when all Iſrael ſaw, that the King harkened not unto them, the People anſwered the King, ſaying, What portion have we in David? &amp;c.</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this his imprudence he was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115693:36"/>ſaid to be <hi>young and tender-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.7. although he had at that time compleated the 41. year of his age, as appears in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.13. — <hi>for Rehoboam was</hi> 41 <hi>years old when he began to reign.</hi> But, bleſſed be God, our Prince may more fitly be compar'd unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> who, though much younger in years than <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> is yet many years elder in wiſdom and experience; which Princely vertue, together with his right to theſe Dominions, he hath, through the grace and mercy of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from his Grandfather <hi>James,</hi> the firſt of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> of his Age; and from his late Majeſty, his no leſſe wiſe and prudent Father. Now, that he is a Prince of eminent wiſdom and prudence, may as eaſily be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, as that there is light and heat in the body of the Sun. And indeed it is evident, beyond all doubt.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:115693:36"/>
            <p n="1">1. By his chooſing rather to get acceſſion to his Throne by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, dutiful, and loyal endeavors of his moſt pious and prudent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, than by the forcible aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Forreigners and Strangers. It may be, ſome may think, this latter had been his beſt and wiſeſt courſe: Seeing, by the aid of ſuch he might have made himſelf more great and abſolute, than he can expect to do, by his coming in upon the loyal and affectionate endeavours of his own Subjects. But, that ſuch may ſee their own imprudence, I would have them to conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That his attempting to come in by ſuch a means as this, would have been very hazardous and uncertain, and ſo by conſequence, imprudent. Had ſtrangers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his Reſtitution by force of Arms, it is probable that many (if not the moſt of thoſe who have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115693:37"/>been active to bring him in, would have been meerly paſſive in it, if not active to keep him out. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, his ſettlement, by this means, would not have been ſo ſure and laſting as now: a Princes greateſt ſecurity lying in the affections of his Subjects. That Prince who gains the hearts of his Subjects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures himſelf a firmer ſettlement by far, than he doth who only conquers their bodies by the force and violence of ſtrangers, and keeps them in ſubjection only by armed Guards and Soldiers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That his coming in by this means would (at leaſt) have endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered the utter deſtruction, if not the irrecoverable loſs of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. 'Tis unqueſtionable, that he could not have conquer'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hazard of the total devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 3 Kingdoms. Beſides, he might have been in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dethroned, by thoſe Foreigners
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115693:37"/>themſelves, when they once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered his own Subjects. We are not without inſtances of the like practiſes of Strangers in former Ages, who (when they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered their enemies) to ſet up themſelves, did not ſtick to depoſe thoſe very Princes that called them in to their aſſiſtance. And indeed he could expect no other from his Popiſh Allies, without making ſhipwrack of that Faith whereof he is the Defender, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Mother of Harlots: it being a received Maxim and Principle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Papiſts, That <hi>Faith is not to be obſerved and kept with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> Beſides, if (as it might have done) the Conqueſt had faln to the ſide of his Oppoſers; his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution would have proved (if not impoſſible, yet) infinitely more difficult, than it hath now appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:115693:38"/>
            <p n="3">3. That a Princes greatneſs and happineſs, doth not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the abſolutenes of his power, as in the affections of his Subjects, and in their cheerful and willing ſubmiſſion to his Perſon and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Now though foreign force may over-awe, yet it cannot gain the hearts of Subjects, though it may force them to ſubmit to the power of their Prince, it will never cauſe them cheerfully to obey their Prince. And therefore this our Prince, in chooſing to be reſtored by his Subjects, rather than by forreign force, hath choſen the beſt way of acceſſion to his Throne, and thereby ſhewed himſelf a wiſe and prudent Prince.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath diſcovered his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent wiſdome and prudence, by his chooſing the Recovery of his Right by a gracious compoſure of things with his truly loyal and faithful Subjects, who in the late unhappy differences adhered both
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115693:38"/>to King and Parliament, rather than to attempt the regaining of it by the forcible help and aid of ſuch as ſtile themſelves <hi>The Royal party.</hi> Doubtleſs, he wanted not ſome, who (like <hi>Rehoboams</hi> young and heady Councellors) gave him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to take this courſe. And it muſt be confeſs'd that ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts have been made to this end: but having found by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant experience, that all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors this way have proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and unſucceſsfull, by reaſon of the indiſcretion of ſome, and the treachery of others; he hath at laſt rejected all Councels tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to force and violence, and wiſely reſolved upon a contrary courſe. And this in a juncture of time, when he had the greateſt hopes of aſſiſtance, not only from Allies and Friends abroad, but alſo from his moſt loyal and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects at home; wherein he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115693:39"/>hath exactly troden in the ſteps of his truly <hi>Heroick and prudent Grandfather, Henry the</hi> 4. <hi>King of France and Navarre;</hi> who, after he had fought many Battels, and obtained as many ſignal Victories, choſe to obtain the poſſeſſion of his <hi>Crown of France</hi> by treaty and capitulation, rather than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the recovery of it by making uſe of further force and violence. And in this reſpect alſo he hath ſhewed himſelf to be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way as wiſe, as <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> by his contrary practice, diſcovered himſelf to be weak and fooliſh.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By caſting himſelf upon his Parliament in order to his own and the ſettlement of his Dominions. By which Act he hath in a manner told them that he is willing to be, or doe, what his beſt and wiſeſt Subjects ſhall thinke beſt and moſt honorable for him, in order to the ſettlement of his Dominions in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115693:39"/>peace &amp; honor; and by this alſo he hath ſhewed himſelfe a truely wiſe and prudent Prince; for by this means he hath, and will, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the hearts of his conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Subjects to <hi>become his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for ever.</hi> As <hi>Rehoboam</hi> would certainely have done, had he put in execution the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the old experienced men. 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 12.7. Conſtant experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſheweth us that Princes gaine more by complying than they do by conteſting with their Subjects. That by gratifying them in ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, they win upon them in greater matters: this <hi>Solomons</hi> old expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Counſellors did very well underſtand, and therefore adviſed <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to comply with his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and to abate ſomething of the rigour of his fathers Government. And this alſo was well underſtood by <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> the wonder both of her age and ſex for <hi>maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115693:40"/>wiſdome and valour</hi> who (by gratifying her Subjects juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in Parliament) became, in a manner the ſole and abſolute Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris both of her Subjects hearts, hands, and purſes. And this was it which made her ſo formidable to her Enemies, and ſo great a comfort and ſupport to her Allies and freinds. Let no man therefore thinke our Prince imprudent in caſting himſelfe upon his <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> for termes of ſettlement: it being the moſt prudential courſe in the world to make him both a great and happy Prince.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He hath ſhewed himſelfe a wiſe and prudent Prince, in reſolving upon the reformation, and ſettlement of the Church by conſent of Parliament, according to the advice of a ſelect Aſſembly of pious and learned Divines. Which indeed is the moſt proper and moſt prudentiall meanes in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115693:40"/>world, to diſcover and reforme thoſe damnable Hereſies, and to make up thoſe Church-deſtroying diviſions that are crept in amongſt us. Who are more likely to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the minde of God, and to finde out wayes and meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling differences and diviſions amongſt Brethren, than godly and learned Divines, whoſe whole work and buſineſs it is to ſtudy the minde and will of God? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this is that means that God himſelf hath appointed for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe evils, as <hi>Acts</hi> 15. doth appear, where we finde the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Elders did aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Synod to this very end. Now by all this it appears, that our Prince is a wiſe and prudent, and ſo by conſequence, a hopeful Prince.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If your view him well with an impartial eye, you ſhal finde him to be an exceeding <hi>Patient and long-fuffering Prince;</hi> a vertue ſo
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115693:41"/>neceſſary, that without it a Prince cannot mannage the affairs of his Kingdome. And in this Princely vertue alſo he far outſhines (if not all, yet) the moſt of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, his moſt Royal Father only excepted. And no wonder, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath been from his <hi>Youth accuſtomed to the yoke,</hi> and inured to affliction. Now his eminency in this Princely vertue doth evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In bearing his great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary afflictions and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of his enemies, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſes of his pretended friends in foreign parts. 1. Without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murring. 2. Without fainting. In reſpect of murmuring, (for any thing I have heard) he was like <hi>David, dumh, and opened not his mouth,</hi> becauſe he knew his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>was the Lords doing, Pſal.</hi> 39.9. And he was ſo far from fainting under them, that he rather gathered
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115693:41"/>ſtrength and courage, by being accuſtomed to the bearing of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This princely vertue appears eminently in him, by his waiting upon God in his greateſt ſtraits, with hope and confidence of his goodneſs and mercy, to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Reſtitution to Rule and Government in his own way and time. In which reſpect it ſeems he had taken up the <hi>Churches reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Mic.</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>I will beare the indignation of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſinned againſt him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he plead my cauſe and execute judgement for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This princely vertue ſhines forth apparently in him, by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the uſe of unlawful means, and by his reſolution (in a way of dependence upon God) to perſiſt in the uſe of all lawfull meanes to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115693:42"/>recover his right. Had he been impatient he would have caſt off the uſe of all meanes like that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and impatient King we read of, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Behold, this evil is of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> Or elſe he would have turn'd aſide to the uſe of ſinful &amp; unlawful means, had he not been a patient Prince, he would have been in danger of changing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in hopes to gain his earthly Crowns, though by ſo doing he had loſt an Eternal Crown.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he is a long ſuffering Prince, appeareth alſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that he hath not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and moved to Acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, by all thoſe wrongs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries that have been done him. If reports be true, when ſome of thoſe. Engliſh Souldiers that were in direct oppoſition againſt him, were taken by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and put into his hand, to be diſpoſed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115693:42"/>of as he thought good; inſtead of revenging himſelfe upon them, he fed and cloathed them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that he ſtill retaines his princely and paternall affections to his Subjects, notwithſtanding all the provocations wherewith he hath been provoked.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If againe you look upon him with an unprejudiced eye, you ſhall finde him to be a <hi>very ſober and moderate Prince.</hi> And that, 1. In <hi>his paſſions.</hi> 2. In <hi>his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The moderation of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appears by his endeavors to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and moderate the paſſions of ſome, who ſtile themſelves the <hi>King's (or Royal) party.</hi> The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his affections appears; by caſting himſelf upon the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, without making any the leaſt demand of having his own power or greatneſſe inlarged or augmented.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If you look upon him with an
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115693:43"/>impartial eye, you ſhall finde him to be a ſelf-denying Prince, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appears, by his referring the ſettlement of things to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. 2. By his reſolution to be adviſed by the Parliament in all things which doe concerne both Church and Sate Affaires. 3. By his <hi>willingneſs to part with his Lands and Revenues</hi> (if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhall thinke fit) in order to the ſettlement <hi>of theſe Nations in peace and tranquility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. If you look upon him with an impartial eye, you ſhall finde him to be a <hi>Gracious, mercifull, and compaſſionate Prince,</hi> which princely vertues do eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in him,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By his readineſſe to pardon his worſt of Enemies, who are not reſolved to perſiſt in their enmity againſt him, excepting ſuch as the Parliament ſhall think fit to exempt from pardon. In which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115693:43"/>reſpect he hath ſhewed himſelf to be a follower of <hi>David,</hi> (that man who was one <hi>after Gods own heart</hi>) who granted an act of Grace to <hi>Shimei,</hi> who curſed, and threw ſtones at him, when he fled from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for fear of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> as you may ſee by comparing 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5, 6, 7, 8. with 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By declaring his readineſſe to grant a General pardon to all parties amongſt us; as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the beſt of us (yea, that ſuch as would be thought his beſt friends) do, in ſome reſpect or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtand in need of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By his profeſſed readineſſe to allow a liberty to men of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſciences, to ſuch as are truly ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By his declared Reſolution, to extend his princely love and favour to all his deſerving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, of what party ſoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115693:44"/>putting the leaſt diſtinction or difference between them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And laſtly, if you look upon him with an unprejudiced eye, you ſhall finde him probably to be a <hi>truly pious and religious Prince;</hi> I ſay; probably to be ſo, and this is the greateſt aſſurance that we can have of any mans pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and religior, in the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By Silvanus a faithfull Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as I ſuppoſe.)</hi> Now that he is ſo, is very probable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By his adhering to the true Proteſtant Religion, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, 1. The injurious dealing of profeſſed Proteſtants, both with his Royal Father and himſelfe. 2. The many kindneſſes of Papiſts heaped upon him, together with their ſtrong temptations to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſeduce him. Beloved, theſe things conſidered, we may be conſident of his piety upon the account of his adhering to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115693:44"/>Religion; for ſome who do not only profeſs themſelves to be Proteſtants, but to be the moſt refined and reformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in the world, have, by thoſe not to be parallel'd inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they have done him, given him the juſteſt occaſion that could be given, to renounce the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion: As namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By their <hi>impudent and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred murther</hi> of his Father, under a pretence of Law and Juſtice; a thing never before done by any profeſſing themſelves Proteſtants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their baniſhing him out of his own Dominions into <hi>Holland,</hi> from thence into <hi>France,</hi> and then into <hi>Flanders,</hi> amongſt the moſt rigid and zealous ſort of <hi>Papists:</hi> by which acts they did, as it were, bid him to go, and to be a <hi>Papist.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> complained that <hi>Saul</hi> did in effect, bid him to <hi>go and ſerve other gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.19.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:115693:45"/>
            <p n="2">2. As the injuries done him by ſeduced Proteſtants have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which might have cauſed him to diſtaſt the Proteſtant Religion; ſo the kindneſſes heaped upon him by Papiſts, have been great. And it is not to be doubted but they have made uſe of both, as induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade him to forſake the proteſtant and to embrace the Popiſh Religion. You may be ſure they have ſufficiently aggravated the miſcariages of thoſe among us who murthered his moſt Royall father, &amp;c. charging that, and all other injuries done him, upon the Parliament and their whole Partie (though the moſt of them did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it from their hearts, endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to prevent it, and do bewail it to this day) nay, they have not been wanting to ſuggeſt unto him, that the principles of Proteſtants do allow and encourage Subjects to murther and depoſe their King.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115693:45"/>This and much more, doubtleſſe, they have ſuggeſted to him, that (if poſſible) they might work in him an abhorrency both of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and of the proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Whilſt, no doubt, on the other hand, they have, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, repreſented to him the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in his Dominions under the notion of his moſt Loyal Subjects, not ſticking to tell him how much they have ſuffered (eſpecially in <hi>Ireland</hi>) for their Loyaltie to his late Majeſty, (though the world knows they were in open rebellion againſt him before the war brake forth in <hi>England</hi>) that they might at once gaine his affections both to his popiſh Subjects, and their Religion. And truely theſe things conſidered, together with his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad among Papiſts and his [then] dependence upon them for ſupply of perſonal wants, and their large promiſes of reſtoring him to his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115693:46"/>juſt Rights and Authority. It is even a miracle that the temptation had not prevailed upon him: for my own part, I queſtion whether the beſt of us would have held conſtant to our Religion, had we been under the like temptation. Nay, when I conſider, upon how ſlight temptations (ſeemingly) the beſt amongſt us have changed both their principles and practice in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; I even conclude, that if any of us had been in his Majeſty's condition, and if his temptations had been ours, we ſhould not have ſtood ſo firm and unſhaken as he hath done. Now, Brethren, it is either pollicy or piety that hath preſerved and kept him. But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be imagined, that he hath been preſerved meerly by policy. Nay, (in appearance) it had been his beſt policy to have changed his Religion; ſeeing, by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115693:46"/>ſo doing he would certainly have obtained all poſſible aſſiſtance, both from <hi>Popiſh Princes</hi> abroad, and from his <hi>Popiſh</hi> Subjects at home: ſo that I conclude, it is not pollicy that hath preſerved him; and therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It muſt be piety and grace in the heart, which hath inabled him (in the midſt of theſe temptations) to adhere unto the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, both in profeſſion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; and that even in thoſe Countries where the Proteſtant Religion is not allowed. And this is the firſt ground upon which I conclude him to be a <hi>pious Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That he is a <hi>pious Prince</hi> is further probable, by his deſire (whilſt he was in <hi>Scotland</hi>) to be delt plainly with, in reſpect of his own perſonal ſins, and the ſins of his Family, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended were the cauſe the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115693:47"/>hand of God was ſo heavy upon him, that he might be humbled for them. In which reſpect he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to imitate <hi>Job,</hi> that great example and pattern of patience, who, in his affliction, begg'd of God, that he <hi>would make him to know his tranſgreſſion and his ſin, Job</hi> 13.23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he is probably a <hi>pious Prince,</hi> is further evident, by his meek and humble behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi> (both in the time of hearing and after) who, in his Coronation-Sermon, dealt both boldly and plainly with him, in laying open his own, and the ſins of his Family. Though this Reverend man (<hi>Nathan</hi>-like, as appears by his Sermon ſince prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) made uſe of his miniſterial Authority to reprove him; he ſhewed not the leaſt diſpleaſure againſt him, either in the time of preaching, or after; but by his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115693:47"/>behavior ſeemed to ſay, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5. <hi>Let the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs, &amp;c.</hi> And by this alſo he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf to be both a <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and a <hi>pious Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. 'T is further probable that he is a <hi>pious Prince,</hi> by his profeſſed deteſtation and abhorrency of profainneſs and impiety; his loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe things, he doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions diſcover, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving men for drunkenneſs, ſwearing, and all ſuch like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and impious practices. And now, Brethren, having ſpoken him a <hi>pious Prince,</hi> I have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the beſt, the <hi>all</hi> that can be ſaid, to make it manifeſt to you, that he is a hopefull Prince, a Prince, by whoſe acceſſion to the Throne, we may well hope for much approaching good both to our Church and State.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:115693:48"/>
            <p>And therefore let us this day, yea, all our dayes, rejoice with an exceeding great rejoycing. But here, I beſeech you, let it not this day, or at any other time, expreſs our joy for his Reſtitution to <hi>Rule and Government</hi> in any way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God, or diſhonorable to His moſt ſacred Majeſty. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, let not any of us dare to do it, ſo as to debauch our ſelves by drinking his health, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon our knees or otherwiſe. This practice, though ſo much uſed amongſt us, doth better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit heathens, than profeſs'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Nay, it is a bruitiſh practice, againſt which even <hi>Heathens</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have thought fit <hi>to enact and make Decrees,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Eſther</hi> 1.8. <hi>And the drinking was according to the Law, none did compel, &amp;c.</hi> Now in the cuſtome of drinking Healths, it is impoſed upon every man, that he drink
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115693:48"/>the ſame quantity and meaſure that others do. Beſides, to be upon our knees drinking, is a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony fitter to be obſerved in an act of worſhip to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> than in our rejoycing at the Proclamation of a Prince ſo truly pious and Chriſtian. So that it is not only diſpleaſing to God, but diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his Majeſty: who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot but diſlike the debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of thoſe who allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the practice of it; ſeeing by ſo doing they repreſent him to the world in the ſhape of a <hi>ſenſual Bacchus,</hi> and not (as indeed he is) a truly noble and religious Prince, who eats in due ſeaſon for ſtrength and not for drunkenneſs. Let us then for ever baniſh this <hi>Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalian cuſtom</hi> from this and all other ſuch like days of Solemnity, and let us leave it to thoſe <hi>whoſe King is a child, and whoſe Princes eat in the morning,</hi> and drown
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115693:49"/>themſelves in ſenſual delights and pleaſures, as the Idolatrous and uſurping Princes of <hi>Samaria</hi> did, as you may ſee <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1, 3, 4, 5, 6. Let us, I ſay, baniſh this wretched cuſtome whereby the <hi>God of glory hath been ſo highly provoked,</hi> and thouſands of precious ſouls have been eternally damned. And let us betake our ſelves to ſuch a way of rejoycing as may be pleaſing to God, and grateful to his Majeſty. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us expreſs our joy in his Majeſty's Reſtitution to his juſt rights both this day and all the days of our lives, by our putting up <hi>ſincere, hearty, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prayers to God for him.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being upon our <hi>knees drinking healths to him,</hi> let us often <hi>proſtrate</hi> our ſelves before <hi>the Throne of Grace</hi> to pour out our ſelves to God for him. Thus the people here in my Text expreſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115693:49"/>their joy at King <hi>Solomons</hi> Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Inauguration. They cryed, <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> and doubtleſs they did it not for the preſent onely, but every day of their lives. And indeed this is a duty that we are commanded to performe on the behalfe of ſuch as are lawfull Rulers, whether they be Kings or others. And ſo to do, the Apoſtle tels you, is <hi>good and acceptable in the ſight of Godour Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. Expreſs we then our joy in his Majeſty's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, by beſeeching the God of life, health and Grace, 1. To give and to beſtow upon him both health of body and length of days: ſay we to God in his behalf, <hi>let the King live and let his ſoul be bound up in the bundle of life with thee.</hi> 2. That God would pour down upon him from day to day a greater portion of that Princely and governing ſpirit wherewith he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115693:50"/>hath already ſo plentifully indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. 3. That he would cauſe his <hi>Crowne to flouriſh upon his head,</hi> maugre all that malice and hatred wherewith <hi>Satan</hi> hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his enemies hearts. 4. That he would give our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both <hi>Church and State,</hi> peace and plenty, truth and proſperity, all his dayes. 5. That he would give him grace more and more to improve his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for his glory and his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches good: that ſo when he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down, together with his life, this <hi>tranſitory and earthly Crown,</hi> he may obtaine that heavenly and <hi>immortall Crown, which God hath laid up, and will beſtow upon all thoſe who love the Lord Jeſus, and long for his appearing.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us expreſs our joy in his Majeſty's Reſtitution, &amp;c. By all outward expreſſions of it that are lawfull and convenient. <hi>Let us
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115693:50"/>eat the fat and drinke the ſweet.</hi> Let the Trumpets ſound, the Bels ring, the Guns roare, the Drums rattle, The Bonfires flame, the people ſhout, ſo as if poſſible to make <hi>the very earth to rend</hi> with the very loud noiſes of their ſhouts and joyful acclamations: thus the text tels us the people here expreſſed their joy at <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Praclamation to be King.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us expreſſe our joy in his Majeſty's Reſtitution, &amp;c. By yeilding all cheerfulobedience and ſubmiſſion to his Majeſty's perſon and juſt Authority all our dayes. And this let us reſolve to doe though it be improved by his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty (as I doubt not but it will) for the <hi>enacting of lawes</hi> to curb and reſtraine us in the practiſe of Sin, and in the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our brutiſh and ſenſuall luſts and pleaſures. Let us not obey his Authority onely whilſt he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115693:51"/>commands thoſe things that ſuite with our intereſts, luſts and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: but alſo when he commands that which is good, though it be croſs and contrary to our own wils and intereſts. So is the will of God that we ſhould do, 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14. If we rejoyce at his Majeſty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation this day, and diſobey his Authority another day, we ſhall but evidence our ſelves to be <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and make our ſelves the more obnoxious to his wrath and juſtice.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us expreſs our joy in His Majeſty's Reſtitution, &amp;c. By ſtopping our eares for ever againſt the bewitching temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch as are given to change. Let the ſmart of our ſufferings under paſt changes, cauſe us to dread the leaſt thought of making our ſelves happy by tearing to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces our antient and beſt forme of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115693:51"/>Government, and attempting to erect a new. Let us no more lend an eare to thoſe <hi>Monſters of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Tyranny,</hi> who had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheated us into ſlavery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of liberty, and who had brought us into bondage unto their owne wills and luſts, by promiſing to ſet us at liberty and make us free. Let the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous opinions and horible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions we have lately ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, cauſe us to tremble at the mention of a <hi>Common-wealth Government,</hi> that hath begotten them. And now that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered our <hi>Pilot,</hi> let us reſolve never to caſt (or ſuffer him to be caſt) overboard againe, leſt we ſuffer ſhipſhwrack for want of him. Let us reſolve, according to the command of God, <hi>Pro.</hi> 24.21, 22. <hi>To feare God and the King, and not to meddle with thoſe that are given to change.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:115693:52"/>
            <p n="5">5. Let us expreſs our joy, &amp;c. By bleſſing and praiſing that God, who by his power and providence hath ſo wonderfully brought it about for us. Certainely it hath not been brought about by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane policy, might, or power, but by the ſpirit and finger of God. <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.6. 'Tis true, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been uſed, and as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments 'tis fit they ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, and we ſhould bleſſe God for them. But who was it that raiſed up thoſe inſtruments? was it not God? who (<hi>as the Apoſtle tells us,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28, 29.) <hi>hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe: and the weake things of the world to confound the things that are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c. that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</hi> Againe, tell me who gave them that wiſdom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage wherby they have been ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to effect what they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted? was it not God? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115693:52"/>it was. So that from firſt to laſt the whole work is his, and the whole glory and praiſe of it is due to him. Let us then this day, and all our days, expreſs our joy in it, by giving God the glory of it. And in our rejoycings let us bleſſe and praiſe the God of Heaven for this his unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercy to us, and unto theſe (almoſt) ruined Kingdomes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>With our ſouls, and all that is within us.</hi> And let us <hi>awaken and ſtir up</hi> our ſouls ſo to do, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did his upon another account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1. Let us bleſs him with our ſouls, by loving, fearing, and admiring of him, and all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible attributes, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in bringing about His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's reſtitution. Let us alſo bleſſe him, by our delighting our ſelvs in him. Let us not expreſs our joy, by taking our fill of delight in the creatures, but by delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115693:53"/>our ſelves in God our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And indeed, this is the beſt way wherein we can expreſſe our joy upon any account in the world. And ſuch a way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing our joy, at the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His Majeſty, would at once evidence us to be the King's beſt Subjects, and God's beſt friends and ſervants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us expreſs our joy upon this account, <hi>in bleſſing and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God with our tongues.</hi> Let us open our mouths, and let our lips ſhew forth the glory of God this day, and all our dayes: God hath given us our tongues to this end, that with them we might ſhew forth his praiſe. Letus then in our rejoycing this day be ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and of thoſe glorious attributes of God, which he hath diſcovered in bringing about this work: This way <hi>David</hi> reſolved to <hi>bleſſe God, Pſal.</hi> 26.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 145.5.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115693:53"/>and prophecyed that other men ſhould do ſo too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.6, 7. yea, <hi>that one generation ſhould tell the works of God to another, that he might not loſe the honour of them, Pſal.</hi> 145.4. So the preſent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration ſhould bleſs God for his mercy in the reſtitution of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, by tranſmitting it to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the generations to come may praiſe him for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us expreſs our joy upon this account, by <hi>bleſſing God with our lives.</hi> Let our lives praiſe God every day that we have to live for his mercy to us, in the reſtitution of His Majeſty this day to his juſt Rights. And let us thus bleſs God,</p>
            <p n="1">1. by endeavouring dayly after a more thorough Reformation of our ſelves and others, as much as in us lies. Now that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored His Majeſty, let us ſit down and conſider with our ſelves what
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115693:54"/>our perſonal ſins are, whereby we did provoke God to ſuffer the worſt of Tyrants to murther his Royal Father, and for ſo many years to baniſh his Majeſty, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcovered them, let us turn from them. Let us do it heartily and unfeignedly, ſo as never to turn to the commiſſion of them more. O, let us reſolve never to provoke this God more, who, notwithſtanding our ſinful provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, hath delivered us from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping Tyrants, and hath reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us our moſt dread and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sovereign.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By dedicating our ſelves heartily, intirely and ſincerely to the fear and ſervice of God. Let the conſideration fo the great things God hath done for us, cauſe us to fear the Lord and ſerve him with our whole heart all our days, according to that of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24. though we have hitherto
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115693:54"/>ſerved Satan, and our own luſts, let us from henceforth reſolve to ſerve no Maſter but God. <hi>As you have yielded your members ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to uncleanneſs &amp; to iniquity unto iniquity; ev en ſo now yield your members ſervants to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs unto holineſs,</hi> according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. and both theſe things I earneſtly beg of you. 1. For your owne ſakes. 2. For His Majeſty's ſake. Leſt if you ſtill do wickedly, you provoke the Lord to deſtroy both your King and your ſelves. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.25. <hi>But if ye ſhall ſtill do wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, ye ſhall be conſumed, both you and your King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By doing what in us lies, in our ſeveral ſtations, to improve his Majeſty's Authority, for the right and proper ends of Authority. Let us not any of us endeavour to improve it for <hi>by and baſe ends of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115693:55"/>our own:</hi> to ſcramble for Honors, Offices, and Preferments for our ſelves, as others have done under the late Uſurpers: But let us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it,</p>
